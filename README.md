### Some Problem Fixes as well as Fun and cool stuff I build along the way, primarily for myself but I upload here so other people can use it if they find it helpful.
**Disclaimer** You might find the worst documentation and worst error listings of your entire life here cz this is primarily for me and I don't have enough time to write good documentation for it. No one reads it anyway.
